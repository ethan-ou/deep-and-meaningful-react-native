# Deep and Meaningful

Deep and Meaningful is a mobile app designed to spark meaningful conversations. It's useful when you're wanting to learn more about someone new, or wanting to go deeper with someone you already trust.

Under the hood, it's powered by Expo/React Native, with global state being managed by React Context.
